        This method attempts to reduce the number of recently played tracks in the earliest portion
        of the playlist by moving them to the end. Unlike scour_playlist, it:
        - Makes multiple passes through the early part of the playlist to gradually improve distribution
        - May not completely eliminate recently played tracks from the earliest portion
        - Stops after reaching a stable minimum or hitting max attempts
        
        This method provides fewer guarantees about the final playlist distribution, but it may end up
        producing playlists more to the users taste by including some recently played tracks sooner and
        preserving some of the earlier randomization.
