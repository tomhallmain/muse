# macOS (OS X): Foundation/Cocoa for optional keychain and native integration.
# Not required for basic keyring usage (utils/encryptor.py works without it).

# Linux: D-Bus for optional Secret Service keyring lock (utils/encryptor.py).
# Not required for basic keyring get/set.
dbus-python; sys_platform == 'linux'

# Required for media key functionality in the Tkinter version (app.py) on all platforms.
