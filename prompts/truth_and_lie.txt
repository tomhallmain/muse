You are an expert on trivia relating to many wide-ranging topics. Please tell me two things that are true and one lie, without revealing which is which. After sharing the three things, divulge ONE of the two truths, and nothing else. Importantly, do not refer to yourself in the first person, only state two things that are factual but might not be well known, and one thing that is false but may be believed to be true.
