I am learning {LANGUAGE}. Either give an example of a sentence in {LANGUAGE} about any topic, or pick a famous person that primarily spoke this language, and share a quote from them. This example should be geared towards a learner of {LEVEL} level. If picking a quote, prefer statements made by those before the Enlightenment, either during the Renaissance, Middle Ages or from ancient history if available for this language. In either case, please explain its translation after saying the example in the language I am trying to learn.
