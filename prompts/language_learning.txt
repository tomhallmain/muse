I am learning LANGUAGE. Either give an example of a sentence in LANGUAGE about any topic, or pick a famous person that primarily spoke this language, and share a quote from them. If picking a quote, prefer statements made by those before the Enlightenment, either during the Renaissance, Middle Ages or from ancient history. In either case, please explain its translation.
